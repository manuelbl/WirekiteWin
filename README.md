# Wirekite for Windows

Wire up digital and analog IOs to your PC and control them with your C# / VB.NET code run on your PC.

To connect the inputs and outputs, use a [Teensy development board](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) connected via USB. It looks a lot like an Arduino Nano connected for programming. Yet with Wirekite the custom code is written for and run on your computer â€“ not for the microcontroller.

This repository contains the Windows code. There are separate repositories for the [Teensy code](https://github.com/manuelbl/Wirekite) and the [MacOS code(https://github.com/manuelbl/WirekiteMac).

## Supported boards

- [Teensy LC](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensylc.html)
- [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html) (soon)

## Supported inputs / outputs / protocols

- Digital output
- Digital input
- Analog input
- PWM output
- I2C (soon)


# Getting started

### 1. Prepare the Teensy board for Wirekite

Download the ready-to-use code for the Teensy and install it on your Teensy board. This is a one-time step.

[See instructions](https://github.com/manuelbl/Wirekite/blob/master/docs/prepare_teensy.md)

### 2. Create your first project

Coming soon...
